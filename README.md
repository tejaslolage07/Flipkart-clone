# Flipkart-clone
This project is a Flipkart clone website. The front end is configured using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website isn't exactly like Flipkart, but one can say it's decent. The more time and effort is invested in the code, the better the website can get. And as this is a short project focussed on learning CSS, I did not invest too much time. Though the end result is a decent and responsive website which can even be taken for production.
